## Hi, everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I am Full Stack Developer. I have been professionally developing websites since 2014, and since 2017 I began to take part in large projects. In future planning to take part in open source projects. And now I am developing my own big project for the soul and to demonstrate professional experience. Soon I will be able to open it for everyone ðŸ˜„

English in middle level. Reading and writing documentation, simple communicating by correspondence. I can understand the speaker's speech and can have a simple conversation.
